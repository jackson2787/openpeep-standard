# Governance

## Stewardship
OpenPEEP is maintained by a neutral Steering Group with representation from:
- Housing providers
- Care sector
- Fire & Rescue Services
- Accessibility/disability advocacy
- Technical maintainers

Decisions are made by simple majority after public comment. Breaking schema changes require:
- An issue with RFC label
- 14-day public review window
- Two maintainersâ€™ approval (one domain, one technical)

## Releases
- Regular: minor/patch as needed
- Major: when breaking changes are adopted
- Each release includes migration notes and updated examples

## Change Proposals
Open an issue with the template, include:
- Problem statement
- Proposed field(s) / constraints
- Mapping to guidance/regulations
- Backward compatibility impact and migration

## Trademark & Naming
"OpenPEEP" may be used to describe compatible implementations. Do not imply endorsement.
